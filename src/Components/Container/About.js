            Hi, I'm Gianluca, I'm an Italian guy that four years ago moved with
            my girlfriend to this beautiful country called Sweden.
            <br />
            After many years and different jobs, I realized that I wasn't
            satisfied and so in January 2020 I started studying on Codecademy to
            become a web developer <br />
            <br />
            In March 2022 I started my current job as a web developer at Tankbar
            AB in Nyk√∂ping.
            <br />
            Since then it's been a continued improvement of my soft skills and
            knowledge regarding WordPress and PHP.
